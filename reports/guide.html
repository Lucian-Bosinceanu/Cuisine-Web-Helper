      <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
          Cuisine Web Helper is a Web application that allows people to quickly find cooking recipes 
          for their next delicious meal. Each recipe has multiple tags associated with it in regard to 
          the ingredients used, cooking methods and tools, food restrictions, life style etc. The search 
          engine is based on providing recipes that satisfies a list of tags provided by the user. In addition
          to this, the users have access to a series of articles that they can read in order to hone their cooking 
          skills or learn something new.

      <h2>3. Main functionalities</h2>
      <p>
        Cuisine Web Helper has two types of users: normal users and administrators. Both of them have a set
        of common functionalities such as login and search for resources (recipes or articles), as described below.
        In addition, admins are responsible with content management. They can create, update and delete resources.  
        A normal user cannot modify application's content, but it has access to a profile page where special food
        restrictions and lifestyles can be checked in order to get appropriate recipes. A common usage flow for a
        normal user is as its follows: open application page, go to register and create account, go to profile and
        set preferences, return to main page and search for recipes.
