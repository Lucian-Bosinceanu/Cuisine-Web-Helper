            A Scholarly HTML document is a valid <a role="doc-biblioref">HTML</a> document that follows
            some additional rules to specialize its meaning and make it predictable to processors
            wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in the following
            sections. While valuable on its own, the content structure defined here is simply a stepping
            stone to enable semantic enrichment, detailed in <a href="#semantics">Semantics
            Overlays</a>. If you would like to write a validation tool, please join us on GitHub.
